**CivicMitra Frontend Development Session Summary**

This document summarizes the work performed during our session, focusing on the frontend UI development for the CivicMitra Complaint Management System.

**I. Initial Setup & Cleanup:**
*   Read `gemini.md` and `instructions.md` for project objectives and guidelines.
*   Deleted unnecessary old frontend files (`frontend/src/pages/*`, most of `frontend/src/components/*` except `ui`, `civicmitra_prompt.md`).
*   Cleared content of `frontend/src/App.jsx` and `frontend/src/App.css` for a clean start.

**II. Core Layout & Theming:**
*   **Global Layout:** Implemented a responsive dashboard layout with a full-width `Navbar` (header) and a vertical `Sidebar` (navigation) below it. (Note: Sidebar was later integrated into Navbar as per user request).
*   **Theming:**
    *   Introduced a "Glossy Glassmorphism" theme with a global gradient background.
    *   Defined custom Tailwind CSS component layers: `.glass-card`, `.glass-navbar`, `.glass-input`, `.form-container-card`, `.kpi-card-solid`, `.value-card-style`.
    *   Implemented dark mode with persistent user preference via `localStorage`.
    *   Ensured consistency across components (cards, forms, navbar, sidebar).
    *   **Buttons:** Redesigned all buttons to be pill-shaped and glossy with gradient backgrounds.
    *   **Forms:** Made form containers (`.form-container-card`) fully opaque and form inputs (`.glass-input`) semi-transparent with a colored focus ring.
    *   **KPI Cards:** Applied a specific background color (`#F5F5FF` light, `#2a2a3a` dark) to KPI cards.
    *   **Value Cards:** Applied a specific background color (`#eaedff` light, `#3a3a5a` dark) to value cards on the landing page.

**III. Page Implementations:**
*   **Landing Page (`/`):**
    *   Built a comprehensive landing page with Hero, Value Cards, How It Works, Departments, and FAQ sections.
    *   Implemented smooth scrolling for internal navigation links in the `LandingHeader`.
    *   Integrated Login/Register forms as dialogs on the landing page.
*   **Authentication Pages:**
    *   Redesigned `Login`, `Register`, `AdminLogin` pages with client-side validation (`react-hook-form`, `zod`).
    *   Created a `ForgotPassword` page.
    *   Implemented a two-panel `AuthLayout` for these pages.
*   **Citizen Pages:**
    *   `CitizenDashboard` (KPIs, recent complaints).
    *   `FileComplaint` (form with `FormFieldBox` component).
    *   `MyComplaints` (reusing `ComplaintTable`).
    *   `ComplaintDetails` (detailed view with timeline/chat placeholders, now editable for staff).
    *   `Feedback` (form with star rating).
*   **Admin Pages:**
    *   `AdminDashboard` (KPIs, analytics, recent complaints).
    *   `UserManagement` (table of users).
    *   `DepartmentManagement` (table of departments).
*   **Staff Pages:**
    *   `StaffDashboard` (department-specific KPIs, filtered complaints).
    *   `DepartmentComplaints` (filtered `ComplaintTable`).
    *   `AssignWorker` (form to assign workers).
    *   `ComplaintDetails` (shared, with staff-specific editable fields).

**IV. Component & Utility Development:**
*   **`FormFieldBox.jsx`:** Created a reusable component for form fields with specific styling.
*   **`ComplaintTable.jsx`:** Enhanced to accept a `filter` prop for role-specific views.
*   **`NotificationContext.jsx`:** Implemented a global context for managing notifications.
*   **`SidebarContext.jsx`:** (Removed as sidebar was integrated into Navbar).
*   **`Dialog.jsx`, `Accordion.jsx`, `Checkbox.jsx`, `Label.jsx`, `Popover.jsx`:** Created/adapted `shadcn/ui` components.

**V. Issues Resolved:**
*   Fixed `ReferenceError` for `lucide-react` icons in `Navbar.jsx`.
*   Fixed `SyntaxError` (missing `</form>`) in `Register.jsx`.
*   Resolved `React.Children.only` error by simplifying button usage in `Hero.jsx`.
*   Addressed responsiveness issues (sidebar positioning, table scrolling).
*   Fixed `DialogContent` background override.
*   Ensured smooth scrolling for anchor links.
*   Resolved various styling inconsistencies and brightness issues based on user feedback.
