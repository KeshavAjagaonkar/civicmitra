# CivicMitra - Change Log

## Latest Update - Worker Role System Implementation (October 7, 2025)

### üéØ Overview
Implemented a complete worker role management system with specialized field worker features, staff assignment capabilities, and real-time progress tracking. Fixed multiple API integration issues and enhanced role-based interfaces across the application.

---

## üöÄ Major Features Added

- License Number

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/controllers/authController.js` - Enhanced registration endpoint
- `backend/models/User.js` - Added worker-specific schema fields

---

### 2. Worker Dashboard (Field-Focused Interface)

**What Changed:**
- Complete redesign focused on field work terminology
- Removed citizen-like features
- Enhanced progress update capabilities

**Key Features:**
- **Field Assignments View** - Only shows complaints assigned to the worker

- "Task Details" ‚Üí "Assignment Details"
- "Timeline" ‚Üí "Work History"
- Added field location emphasis
- Citizen contact information prominently displayed

---

### 3. Staff Worker Management System

**What Changed:**
- Created comprehensive worker management interface for staff
- Two methods to assign workers to complaints
- Department-filtered worker lists

**New Component:**
- `frontend/src/pages/staff/WorkerManagement.jsx` (378 lines)

**Features:**
- **View All Workers** - Department-filtered list with full details
- **Assign Tasks** - Quick assignment from worker management page
- **Worker Details** - ID, specialization, experience, contact info
- **Active Status** - Filter by active/inactive workers
- **Assignment Dialog** - Select unassigned complaints and assign to worker

**Assignment Methods:**
1. **From Worker Management:**
   - Click "Assign Task" on any worker
   - Select from unassigned complaints
   - Confirm assignment

2. **From Complaints Table:**
   - Click "Assign" button on unassigned complaint
   - Select worker from department
   - Confirm assignment

**Files Added/Modified:**
- `frontend/src/pages/staff/WorkerManagement.jsx` - NEW FILE

- `frontend/src/pages/staff/StaffDashboard.jsx` - Removed "Add Worker" button
- `frontend/src/components/ComplaintTable.jsx` - Added "Assign" button for staff

---

### 4. Worker Progress Tracking & Timeline Updates

**What Changed:**
- Workers can update complaint progress with detailed notes
- Updates appear in citizen's complaint timeline
- Real-time notifications to citizens

**How It Works:**
1. Worker selects assigned task
2. Fills progress update form:
   - Status: "In Progress" or "Resolved"
   - Notes: Detailed description of work done
3. Submits update
4. Timeline automatically updated
5. Citizen receives notification

**Backend Integration:**
- Endpoint: `PUT /api/complaints/:id/worker-update`
- Timeline entry with worker details
- Notifications sent to citizen
- Status updates reflected immediately

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/pages/worker/WorkerDashboard.jsx` - ProgressUpdateForm component
- `frontend/src/pages/worker/TaskDetails.jsx` - Update progress tab
- `frontend/src/components/WorkerUpdateForm.jsx` - Already correct

---

### 5. Enhanced Navigation & Routing

**What Changed:**
- Department-based routes for staff
- Role-specific navigation items
- Consistent URL structure

**Staff Routes:**
- `/water/staff/workers` - Worker management (department-specific)
- `/water/staff/complaints` - Department complaints
- `/water/staff/complaints/:id/assign` - Assign worker to complaint

**Worker Routes:**
- `/worker` - Dashboard
- `/worker/tasks` - All assignments
- `/worker/tasks/:id` - Task details with update capability

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Added WorkerManagement route
- `frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx` - Department-based navigation for staff

**Sidebar Changes:**
- Staff now sees department-specific routes
- Removed "Assign Worker" from sidebar (accessed via complaints)
- Worker navigation: Dashboard, All Assignments, Profile, My Reports

---

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### 1. Worker Registration Role Assignment
**Problem:** Workers registering through the form were being assigned "citizen" role

**Root Cause:** Backend hardcoded role to "citizen" regardless of request

**Solution:**
- Updated `authController.js` to accept role from request body
- Added role validation (citizen, worker, staff)
- Department name to ID conversion for workers
- Made address field optional for workers

**Impact:** Workers can now properly register and access worker features

---

### 2. API Request Syntax Errors
**Problem:** "Failed to execute 'fetch' on Window: '[object Object]' is not a valid HTTP method"

**Root Cause:** Using object-based syntax `{ method: 'PATCH', body: {...} }` instead of the correct `request(url, method, body)` signature

**Files Fixed:**
- `frontend/src/pages/staff/WorkerManagement.jsx` - Worker assignment
- `frontend/src/pages/staff/AssignWorker.jsx` - Complaint assignment
- `frontend/src/pages/worker/WorkerDashboard.jsx` - Progress updates
- `frontend/src/pages/worker/TaskDetails.jsx` - Progress updates
- `frontend/src/hooks/useWorkerData.js` - Fetch assigned complaints

**Before:**
```javascript
await request('/api/endpoint', {
  method: 'PATCH',
  body: { data }
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
await request(
  '/api/endpoint',
  'PATCH',
  { data }
);
```

**Impact:** All worker and staff API calls now work properly without errors

---

## üìä Data Model Changes

### User Model Enhancements
**Added Fields:**
```javascript
{
  workerId: String (unique, sparse),
  specialization: String,
  experienceYears: Number,
  shiftPreference: String,
  vehicleNumber: String,
  licenseNumber: String,
  address: String (now optional for workers)
}
```

**Field Validation:**
- `workerId` - Unique but allows null (sparse index)
- `experienceYears` - Minimum 0
- `address` - Required only for citizens
- `department` - Required for staff and workers

---

## üîê Authorization & Security

### Role-Based Access Control
**Implemented:**
- Workers can only see/update their assigned complaints
- Staff can only see/assign workers in their department
- Citizens can only view their own complaints
- Proper authorization checks on all endpoints

### Backend Authorization Checks:
```javascript
// Worker can only update their assigned complaints
if (complaint.workerId?.toString() !== req.user.id) {
  return next(new ErrorResponse('Not authorized', 403));
}
```

### Frontend Route Protection:
- `<WorkerRoute>` - Protects worker pages
- `<StaffRoute>` - Protects staff pages
- `<CitizenRoute>` - Protects citizen pages

---

## üîî Notification System

### Worker Assignment Notifications
**When staff assigns worker:**
1. **Worker receives:** "New Task Assigned: [Complaint Title]"
2. **Citizen receives:** "A worker is now assigned to your complaint: [Complaint Title]"

### Progress Update Notifications
**When worker updates progress:**
1. **Citizen receives:** "Progress Update: An update was posted for your complaint: [Complaint Title]"

**Implementation:**
- `createAndEmitNotification()` function in backend
- Real-time notifications via socket.io
- Persistent notification storage

---

**Key Changes:**
- Emphasis on location and citizen contact
- Quick-access progress update forms
- Performance-based KPIs
- Field work terminology throughout

### Staff Interface

2. Verify role is set to "worker"
3. Verify department association
4. Login and access worker dashboard

**Worker Assignment:**
1. Staff views unassigned complaints
2. Assigns worker to complaint
3. Worker receives notification
4. Complaint appears in worker dashboard

**Progress Updates:**
1. Worker opens assigned task
2. Submits progress update
3. Timeline updated immediately
4. Citizen sees update and receives notification

**Authorization:**
1. Worker tries to update another worker's task (should fail)
2. Staff tries to assign worker from different department (should fail)
3. Citizen tries to access worker pages (should redirect)
