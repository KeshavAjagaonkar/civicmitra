---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Backend Changes:**

#### **Complaint Model** (`backend/models/Complaint.js`)
Added new optional field `aiSummary`:
```javascript
aiSummary: {
  shortSummary: String,          // One-line summary (max 200 chars)
  keyPoints: [String],            // 3-5 bullet points
  extractedInfo: {
    mainIssue: String,           // Core problem (2-3 words)
    location: String,            // Location extracted
    urgency: String,             // Low/Medium/High/Critical
    affectedArea: String,        // Scope of impact
  },
  sentiment: String,             // Neutral/Concerned/Frustrated/Angry/Urgent
  generatedAt: Date,             // Timestamp
}
```

#### **AI Service** (`backend/services/aiService.js`)
New function: `summarizeComplaint(title, description, location, category)`
- Uses Gemini AI to generate intelligent summaries
- Extracts key information automatically
- Detects urgency and sentiment
- Fallback to basic summary if AI fails

#### **Complaint Controller** (`backend/controllers/complaintController.js`)
- Integrated AI summarization in complaint creation
- Runs in background (doesn't block complaint filing)
- Graceful error handling (complaint created even if AI fails)

### 2. **Frontend Changes:**

#### **ComplaintDetails.jsx**
Added beautiful AI summary display:
- Shows at top of complaint details
- Displays short summary with sparkle icon
- Shows key points as bullet list
- Shows urgency, sentiment, and affected area badges
- Blue gradient background to stand out

#### **ComplaintManagement.jsx** (Admin)
Added AI summary in complaints list:
- Shows below complaint title
- Sparkle icon indicates AI-generated content
- Helps admin quickly scan complaints
