## üìß How to Enable Email Notifications (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Gmail App Password

1. **Go to Google Account Security:**
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Sign in with your Gmail account

2. **Enable 2-Step Verification** (if not already enabled):
   - Scroll down to "2-Step Verification"
   - Click on it and follow the setup wizard
   - This is REQUIRED for app passwords

3. **Generate App Password:**
   - Go back to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Scroll down to "2-Step Verification"
   - At the bottom, click "App passwords"
   - Select "Mail" as the app
   - Select "Other (Custom name)" as the device
   - Enter "CivicMitra" as the name
   - Click "Generate"
   - **IMPORTANT:** Copy the 16-digit password (looks like: `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx`)

### Step 2: Update Your `.env` File

Open `backend/.env` and fill in the email configuration:

```env
# Email Configuration (Gmail SMTP)
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
EMAIL_FROM="CivicMitra <your-email@gmail.com>"
```

**Example:**
```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=keshav@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
EMAIL_FROM="CivicMitra <keshav@gmail.com>"
```

### Step 3: Restart Your Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: "Email service not configured" in console

**Solution:**
- Check if EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS are filled in `.env`
- Restart the backend server
- Make sure there are no extra spaces in the values

### Problem 2: Emails not being received

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Wrong Gmail credentials:**
   - Verify EMAIL_USER is correct
   - Verify EMAIL_PASS is the 16-digit app password (NOT your Gmail password)

2. **2-Step Verification not enabled:**
   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Enable 2-Step Verification first

3. **Email in spam folder:**
   - Check your spam/junk folder
   - Mark CivicMitra emails as "Not Spam"

4. **Gmail blocking "less secure apps":**
   - This shouldn't happen with app passwords
   - But if it does, use app passwords instead of regular password

### Problem 3: "Invalid login" error

**Solution:**
- You're using your regular Gmail password instead of app password
- Generate a NEW app password and use that instead

### Problem 4: Emails sent but console shows error

**Solution:**
- Check backend console for specific error messages
- Common errors:
  - `EAUTH`: Wrong credentials
  - `ETIMEDOUT`: Network/firewall issue
  - `ECONNREFUSED`: Gmail SMTP blocked

## üîí Security Notes

### ‚úÖ **Safe to Use:**
- App passwords are MORE secure than regular passwords
- App passwords can be revoked anytime
- They're specific to one application
- They don't give access to your Google Account

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
- NEVER commit your `.env` file to GitHub
- `.env` is already in `.gitignore`
- Don't share your app password with anyone

### üîê **Revoking Access:**
If you need to revoke email access:
1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Click "2-Step Verification"
3. Click "App passwords"
4. Find "CivicMitra" and click "Remove"
