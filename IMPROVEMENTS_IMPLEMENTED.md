## Summary of Changes

### 1. Deadline Management for Worker Assignments ✅

**Backend Changes:**

**Features:**

- Timeline and notifications updated when deadline changes

### 2. Stats Page for Staff with Download Options ✅

**Backend:**
- Uses existing `/api/complaints/stats` endpoint
- Uses existing `/api/complaints/all` for detailed data
- Uses existing `/api/admin/users` for worker data

**Frontend:**
- Created comprehensive `StaffStats.jsx` page showing:
  - Department overview statistics (total, submitted, in progress, resolved, resolution rate)
  - Workers status with assigned task counts
  - Recent complaints list
  - Download functionality for Excel and PDF formats

**Features:**
- Export to Excel (XLSX) with multiple sheets:
  - Statistics overview
  - Complete complaints list with deadline info
  - Workers list with activity status
- Export to PDF with formatted tables and professional layout
- Real-time worker activity tracking
- Department-specific filtering

**Dependencies Added:**
- `xlsx` - For Excel export functionality
- `jspdf` - For PDF generation
- `jspdf-autotable` - For formatted PDF tables

### 3. Staff Rights to Modify Assignment ✅

**Features Implemented:**
- Staff can change deadline at any time
- Staff can reassign complaints to different workers
- All changes are logged in complaint timeline
- Notifications sent to:
  - Old worker (if reassigned)
  - New worker (with updated deadline)
  - Citizen (about assignment update)

**UI Components:**
- Edit button appears next to assigned complaints
- Assignment update form with:
  - Worker selection dropdown (shows current worker)
  - Deadline date picker
  - Validation for changes
  - Cancel and Update buttons

### 4. Worker Activity Status Filter ✅

**Implementation:**
- Updated `WorkerManagement.jsx` with activity status filter
- Activity is determined by assigned active complaints (not Resolved/Closed)
- Filter options: All Workers, Active Only, Inactive Only

**Features:**
- Replaced "Experience" column with "Assigned Tasks" showing active task count
- Activity status badge (Active/Inactive) based on current assignments
- Real-time filtering of worker list
- Summary cards show correct active worker count
- Workers can be assigned tasks regardless of activity status

**Activity Logic:**
- A worker is "Active" if they have at least one complaint assigned that is not Resolved or Closed
- A worker is "Inactive" if they have no active assignments
- The filter allows staff to quickly find available workers
