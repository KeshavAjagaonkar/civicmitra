# React Error Fix - "React.Children.only" Issue

## Error Description
```
Error: React.Children.only expected to receive a single React element child.
```

This error occurred in the `Slot.SlotClone` component from Radix UI.

## Root Cause

**NOT a database issue!** This was a React component structure error.

The error was caused by Badge components with multiple direct children. Radix UI's Badge component uses a Slot internally which expects a single React element child, but we were passing two separate elements (an icon and text) directly:

```jsx
// ❌ WRONG - Multiple children causing error
<Badge variant={...} className="flex items-center gap-1">
  {getStatusIcon(complaint.status)}    // First child
  {complaint.status}                    // Second child
</Badge>
```

## Solution

Wrapped the multiple children in a single `<span>` element:

```jsx
// ✅ CORRECT - Single child with nested content
<Badge variant={...} className="flex items-center gap-1">
  <span className="flex items-center gap-1">
    {getStatusIcon(complaint.status)}
    {complaint.status}
  </span>
</Badge>
```

## Files Fixed

1. **`frontend/src/pages/staff/ComplaintManagement.jsx`** (Line 251-256)
   - Fixed Badge component with status icon and text

## What Was NOT Changed

✅ **Database:** No database changes were made
✅ **Backend API:** All backend endpoints remain the same
✅ **Data Structure:** No changes to data models
✅ **Other Components:** Only the Badge component structure was fixed

## Why This Error Happened

The error appeared after adding icons to Badge components for better UX. The Radix UI Badge component internally uses Radix's Slot API which has strict rules about children:
- Slot components expect exactly ONE React element as a child
- When multiple children are provided, they must be wrapped in a single parent element

## Testing

After this fix, the staff pages should load without errors:
- ✅ Staff Dashboard
- ✅ Staff Complaints Page
- ✅ Staff Workers Page
- ✅ Staff Statistics Page

## Summary

**Issue:** React component structure error with Badge having multiple children
**Cause:** Badge component (using Radix Slot) received two children instead of one
**Fix:** Wrapped children in a single `<span>` element
**Impact:** Frontend-only fix, no backend/database changes
