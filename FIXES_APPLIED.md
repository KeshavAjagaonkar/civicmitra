# Fixes Applied - AI Summary & Department Routing

## 🐛 Issues Fixed:

### Issue 1: AI Summary Not Showing
**Problem:** AI summaries were not generating for new complaints

**Root Cause:** Gemini API model name changed from `gemini-pro` to `gemini-1.5-flash`

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `backend/services/aiService.js`
- Changed model from `'gemini-pro'` to `'gemini-1.5-flash'`
- Applied to both `classifyComplaint()` and `summarizeComplaint()` functions

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/services/aiService.js` (lines 21, 132)

---

### Issue 2: Department Not Auto-Routing
**Problem:** Complaints were not being automatically assigned to departments based on category

**Root Cause:** `getDepartmentByCategory()` function was returning `null` (not implemented)

**Fix Applied:**

1. **Implemented Department Mapping** (`backend/services/aiService.js`):
   ```javascript
   const categoryToDepartment = {
     'Roads': 'Public Works',
     'Water Supply': 'Water Department',
     'Sanitation': 'Sanitation Department',
     'Electricity': 'Electricity Department',
     'Public Health': 'Health Department',
     'Street Lights': 'Electricity Department',
     'Drainage': 'Water Department',
     'Garbage': 'Sanitation Department',
     'Other': null
   };
   ```

2. **Updated Complaint Creation** (`backend/controllers/complaintController.js`):
   - Added automatic department lookup if not provided by user
   - Added console logging for debugging
   - Department assigned before complaint creation

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/services/aiService.js` (lines 110-137)
- `backend/controllers/complaintController.js` (lines 7, 36-42)

## ✅ What Now Works:

### 1. AI Complaint Summarization:
- ✅ Generates short summary (max 150 chars)
- ✅ Extracts 3-5 key points
- ✅ Detects urgency level (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- ✅ Analyzes sentiment (Neutral/Concerned/Frustrated/Angry/Urgent)
- ✅ Identifies affected area scope
- ✅ Displays in beautiful blue gradient box
- ✅ Shows on complaint details page
- ✅ Shows in admin complaints list

### 2. Automatic Department Routing:
- ✅ Maps complaint categories to correct departments
- ✅ Auto-assigns department on complaint creation
- ✅ Falls back gracefully if department not found
- ✅ Console logging shows assignment status

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### If AI Summary Still Not Showing:

1. **Check Backend Console** for errors
2. **Verify Gemini API Key** in `.env` file
3. **Check API Rate Limits** (free tier: 60 requests/minute)
4. **Network Issues** - check internet connection

### If Department Not Assigned:

1. **Check Backend Console** for: `🏢 Auto-assigned department for category...`
2. **Verify Departments Exist** in database:
   - Public Works
   - Water Department
   - Sanitation Department
   - Electricity Department
   - Health Department
3. **Category Spelling** must match exactly

## 📝 Category → Department Mapping:

| Category | Department |
|----------|-----------|
| Roads | Public Works |
| Water Supply | Water Department |
| Sanitation | Sanitation Department |
| Electricity | Electricity Department |
| Public Health | Health Department |
| Street Lights | Electricity Department |
| Drainage | Water Department |
| Garbage | Sanitation Department |
| Other | (Not auto-assigned) |
