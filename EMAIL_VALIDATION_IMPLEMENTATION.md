# Email Validation Implementation - CivicMitra

## 📋 Summary

This document describes the email validation implementation for CivicMitra, ensuring **Citizens and Workers use real Gmail/email addresses** while **Admin and Staff can continue using dummy emails**.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Email Validation Rules**

| Role | Email Type | Validation | Example |
|------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Citizen** | ✅ Real Email Required | Format validation + Duplicate check | `citizen@gmail.com` |
| **Worker** | ✅ Real Email Required | Format validation + No @civicmitra.com + Duplicate check | `worker@gmail.com` |
| **Staff** | ⚠️ Dummy Allowed | No restrictions | `staff@civicmitra.com` |
| **Admin** | ⚠️ Dummy Allowed | No restrictions | `admin@civicmitra.com` |

## 🔧 Backend Changes

### File: `backend/controllers/authController.js`

**Lines 29-42:** Added email validation for **Citizens** during registration

```javascript
// Email validation for Citizens (most common registration)
if (userRole === 'citizen') {
  // Validate email format
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  if (!emailRegex.test(email)) {
    return next(new ErrorResponse('Please provide a valid email address', 400));
  }

  // Check if email already exists
  const existingUser = await User.findOne({ email });
  if (existingUser) {
    return next(new ErrorResponse('Email is already registered. Please login instead.', 400));
  }
}
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Validates email format (must be `name@domain.com`)
- ✅ Prevents duplicate citizen registrations
- ✅ Gives clear error messages

---

### File: `backend/controllers/adminController.js`

**Lines 22-40:** Added email validation for **Workers** when Admin creates accounts

```javascript
// Email validation for WORKERS only (Citizens register themselves, Admin/Staff can use dummy)
if (role === 'worker') {
  // Validate email format
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  if (!emailRegex.test(email)) {
    return next(new ErrorResponse('Please provide a valid email address for worker', 400));
  }

  // Check if it's a real email domain (not @civicmitra.com)
  if (email.endsWith('@civicmitra.com')) {
    return next(new ErrorResponse('Workers must use a real email address (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.). Dummy emails are not allowed for workers.', 400));
  }

  // Check if email already exists
  const existingUser = await User.findOne({ email });
  if (existingUser) {
    return next(new ErrorResponse(`Email ${email} is already registered`, 400));
  }
}
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Validates email format for workers
- ✅ Blocks @civicmitra.com emails for workers
- ✅ Prevents duplicate worker emails
- ✅ Staff can still use dummy emails (no validation for staff role)

## 🎨 Frontend Changes

### File: `frontend/src/pages/admin/UserManagement.jsx`

**Lines 111-136:** Updated the "Create User" form with dynamic email guidelines

**New Features:**
1. **Dynamic Placeholder:**
   - Worker: Shows `worker@gmail.com`
   - Staff: Shows `email@example.com`

2. **Role-Based Instructions:**
   - **Worker Selected:** Shows orange warning:
     ```
     ⚠️ Important: Workers MUST use a real email (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.).
     Dummy emails are not allowed for workers.
     ```

   - **Staff Selected:** Shows gray info:
     ```
     Staff can use dummy emails (e.g., staff@civicmitra.com) or real emails.
     ```

3. **Real-Time Error Detection:**
   - If worker email ends with `@civicmitra.com`, shows red error:
     ```
     ❌ Error: Workers cannot use @civicmitra.com emails.
     Please use a real email address.
     ```

## 📝 Important Notes

### **For Admin Users:**

1. **Creating Workers:**
   - MUST use real emails (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.)
   - Will receive notifications at this email
   - Cannot use @civicmitra.com

2. **Creating Staff:**
   - Can use dummy emails like `staff1@civicmitra.com`
   - Can also use real emails
   - Both options work

3. **Existing Users:**
   - All existing workers/staff continue to work
   - No need to update existing accounts
   - Only new workers need real emails

### **Error Messages:**

If you see these errors, here's what to do:

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Please provide a valid email address" | Use format: `name@domain.com` |
| "Workers must use a real email address" | Don't use `@civicmitra.com` for workers |
| "Email is already registered" | Use a different email or login with existing account |

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to send real emails to citizens and workers:

1. **Set up Gmail SMTP** (5 minutes)
   - Add to `.env`:
     ```
     EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
     EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
     EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
     ```

2. **Email Notifications:**
   - Citizens get complaint updates via email
   - Workers get assignment notifications via email
   - Staff/Admin only see in-app notifications
