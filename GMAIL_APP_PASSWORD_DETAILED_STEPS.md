# Gmail App Password - Detailed Step-by-Step Guide

## 🎯 What You're Looking For

You need to generate a special 16-digit password that looks like this:
```
abcd efgh ijkl mnop
```

This is NOT your regular Gmail password. It's a special password just for apps.

---

## 📝 Method 1: Direct Link (Fastest)

### Step 1: Use This Direct Link

Click this link (make sure you're logged into your Gmail account):

**https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords**

OR

**https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords**

### Step 2: Sign In

- If asked, sign in with your Gmail email and password
- You might need to verify it's you (enter phone code, etc.)

### Step 3: Generate Password

Once on the App Passwords page:

1. You'll see "App passwords" at the top
2. Under "Select app", there might be a dropdown or text field
3. **If you see a dropdown:**
   - Click on it
   - Select "Mail"

4. **If you see "App name" text field:**
   - Type: `CivicMitra` or `Mail`

5. Click **"Generate"** or **"Create"** button

6. **COPY the 16-digit password shown** (it will have spaces like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

7. Click "Done"

## 📝 Method 2: If Direct Link Doesn't Work

### Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification First

**Why?** App passwords only work if 2-Step Verification is ON.

1. Go to: **https://myaccount.google.com/security**

2. Scroll down and find **"2-Step Verification"** or **"2-factor authentication"**

3. Click on it

4. Click **"Get Started"** or **"Turn On"**

5. Follow the steps:
   - Enter your phone number
   - Choose SMS or phone call
   - Enter the verification code you receive
   - Click "Turn On" or "Enable"

### Step 2: Access App Passwords

**Option A - Through Security Page:**

1. Go to: **https://myaccount.google.com/security**

2. Scroll down to section **"Signing in to Google"**

3. Look for **"App passwords"** or **"2-Step Verification"**

4. Click on **"App passwords"**

**Option B - Through 2-Step Verification:**

1. Go to: **https://myaccount.google.com/security**

2. Click on **"2-Step Verification"**

3. Scroll to the bottom of that page

4. Look for **"App passwords"** (usually at the bottom)

5. Click on it

### Step 3: Create App Password

1. You might be asked to sign in again (for security)

2. You'll see "App passwords" page with these options:

   **Select app:** Choose "Mail" or "Other"

   **Select device:** Choose "Other (Custom name)"

3. If it says "App name" or "Custom name":
   - Type: `CivicMitra`

4. Click **"Generate"**

5. A popup will show a **16-digit password** like:
   ```
   abcd efgh ijkl mnop
   ```

6. **IMPORTANT:** Copy this password immediately!

7. Click "Done"

## 📝 Method 3: If You Don't See "App Passwords" Option

### Possible Reasons:

**1. 2-Step Verification is not enabled**
- Solution: Follow Method 2 Step 1 above to enable it

**2. You're using a work/school Google account**
- Solution: These accounts might have restrictions
- Use a personal Gmail account instead

**3. Your Google account has "Less secure app access" enabled**
- Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
- Turn it OFF
- Then you'll be able to use App Passwords

**4. Your account is too new**
- Some very new Google accounts may need to wait 24-48 hours

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use my regular Gmail password instead?**
A: No, Gmail blocks apps from using regular passwords. You MUST use an app password.

**Q: Is app password safe?**
A: Yes! It's actually MORE safe because:
- You can revoke it anytime
- It only works for email, not your full Google account
- If compromised, just delete it and generate a new one

**Q: Can I use the same app password for multiple apps?**
A: Yes, but it's better to generate separate ones for each app for security.

**Q: What if I lose the app password?**
A: You can't retrieve it. Just generate a new one and update your `.env` file.

**Q: How do I delete an app password?**
A: Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
Click the ❌ or trash icon next to the password you want to remove.
